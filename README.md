# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation to build an accurate classifier capable of identifying fraud.

## Project Overview

The aim is to develop a model that can effectively classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate by analyzing transaction features. The workflow comprises:

- Loading and inspecting the credit card transaction dataset
- Exploring data patterns, including class imbalance and feature distributions
- Preprocessing and preparing data for modeling
- Training classification models and evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset Features

The dataset includes anonymized features obtained with PCA transformation (V1 to V28), along with:

- Time: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
- Amount: Transaction amount
- Class: Target variable (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraud)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization


## Notebook Contents

- **Data Loading and Overview:** Viewing dataset structure and distribution
